# Create a program that checks if a word is a palindrome. 

Your task is to create a program that accepts a word from the user then says if it is a palindrome or not. A palindrome is a word that can be read forwards or backward. Some examples of this are 'racecar', 'madam', and 'kayak'.

You have most of the tools to complete this lesson, but do not know how to index or how to find the length of a string. When you do not know how to do something, the best place to check is the language's documentation or search on Google. We have gone through the work of finding the documentation and as part of the exercise, you need to figure out how _.charAt()_, _.length()_, and the _Scanner_ class can be used.

**Documentation:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/charAt)

**Documentation:** [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String/length)

**Article on input:** [https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_user_input.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/java/java_user_input.asp)

What you need:

- A way to get user input
- A way to check the length of a word (used in the _if_ statement)
- Create a boolean for if it is or is not a palindrome
- Create a for loop to go through the word
- Check if the character on either end is equivalent
- Print that it is or is not a palindrome

# **There are many solutions to this, be creative!**
